# Welcome to Adam Niggebrugge's Developer Portfolio

## Overview
I want to give perspective employers or clients a chance to evaluate my work from a single convenient place.

## Tech
HTML, Javascript (jquery, Materialize components) , CSS (Materialize).
Please look at the formatting of HTML, as I think I formatted in an interesting manner for quicker ðŸ”Ž reading, tho maybe there is a precedent already out there for this vertical sytling of tags and attributes. Indentation still needs work ðŸš§
